 - **Use your favourite language** 
   - [Behavior Driven Development](https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/) and [OpenAPI](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) are not linked to a specific language
 - **Use git** 
   - theGardener scan only projects hosted on a git repository
 - **Use feature branching and merge requests**
   - Your documentation will be reviewed with a pair at the same time as the code: you will trust your documentation  
 - _(Optional but recommended)_ Write code with Behaviour Driven Development
   - It would help showing meaningful examples
 - _(Optional but recommended)_ On web services development, use OpenAPI format (For instance, use Swagger) 
   - It would avoid you copy past of model and endpoint descriptions
