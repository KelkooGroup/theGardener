### Developer guide lines

1. **Eat our own dog food**: We are building an application to help BDD (Behavior Driven Development), so let's drive the development by Cucumber scenarios ! And when the application will be enough evolved, just use it for our own development and documentation.
1. **Keep It Simple**: Do not bother complicate the code or anticipate future features. With a good BDD cover, we will be able to refactor our code easily if needed.
1. **Clean code**: Let's have a nice source base that we are proud of. ([Clean Code Cheat Sheet ](https://www.bbv.ch/images/bbv/pdf/downloads/V2_Clean_Code_V3.pdf))
1. **Convention over configuration**: Make life as easy as possible to theGardener users: the code should adapt to some convention so that users have the less possible configuration to define.
1. **Enjoy !**
