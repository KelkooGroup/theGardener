Feature: On synchronize, compute pages and store them in the cache

  Background:
    Given the database is empty
    And the cache is empty
    And the menu reloaded count is reset
    And No project is checkout
    And the hierarchy nodes are

      | suggestionsWS | Suggestions WebServices | target/data/GetPages/library/suggestionsWS/ | master       | doc                   |
    And the links between hierarchy nodes are
      | projectId     | hierarchyId |
      | suggestionsWS | .01.        |
    And we have those branches in the database
      | id | name   | isStable | projectId     |
      | 1  | master | true     | suggestionsWS |
    And the server "target/data/GetPages" host under the project "library/suggestionsWS" on the branch "master" the file "doc/thegardener.json"
