      | .    | root       | Hierarchy root    | Views         | View       |
      | .01. | suggestion | Suggestion system | Projects      | Project    |
    And we have the following projects
      | id            | name                    | repositoryUrl                                         | stableBranch | featuresRootPath | documentationRootPath |
      | suggestionsWS | Suggestions WebServices | target/remote/data/GetFeatures/library/suggestionsWS/ | master       | test/features    | doc                   |

      | projectId     | hierarchyId |
      | suggestionsWS | .01.        |
    And we have those branches in the database
      | id | name   | isStable | projectId     |
