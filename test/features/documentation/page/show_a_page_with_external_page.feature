  Background:
    Given the database is empty
    And the cache is empty
    And No project is checkout
    And the remote projects are empty
    And the hierarchy nodes are
      | id   | slugName   | name              | childrenLabel | childLabel |
      | .    | root       | Hierarchy root    | Views         | View       |
      | .01. | suggestion | Suggestion system | Projects      | Project    |
    And we have the following projects

      | suggestionsWS | Suggestions WebServices | target/remote/data/GetFeatures/library/suggestionsWS/ | master       | test/features    | doc                   |
    And the links between hierarchy nodes are
      | projectId     | hierarchyId |
      | suggestionsWS | .01.        |
    And we have those branches in the database
      | id | name   | isStable | projectId     |
      | 1  | master | true     | suggestionsWS |
    And we have those directories in the database
      | id | name | label         | description             | order | relativePath | path                   | branchId |
      | 1  | root | SuggestionsWS | Suggestions WebServices | 0     | /            | suggestionsWS>master>/ | 1        |
    And we have those pages in the database
      | id | name    | label       | description               | order | relativePath | path                          | markdown | directoryId |
